# DDosProject
Final Year Project
Week 1 - 1/07/2021 - 04/07/2021
Planning
installing Libraries and tools 
Figma Wire Frame Prototyping

week 2 - 04/07/2021 - 12/07/2021

Data analysis and feature selection 
data fitting &  training basic fot 
pytorch Nueral net 
Random FOrest 
skorch Nueral network

week3 - 12/07/2021 - 20/07/21
I was only able to work on the React web app  due to time constraint of full time job

week4 20/07/21 - 26/07/20201
fetching data from Flask back-end to react front end parsing the data and filling the graph
Resolved the CORS problem preventing the react and flask communication 
Posting data from react to flask 
preparation for flask app deploymeny to heroku 
mutliple attempt to deploy  successful deploy but with internal server error
fixed deploy (bug/error).
post deploy bugs diagnosing 

week 4 - 20/07/21 - 04/08/21
This week I solved the problem of my dataset bbeing too big and causing issues during deployment 
such as saved models files of Machine Learning (ML) being too big for git commits and the back end server timing out duting deplyoment due to large dataset processing 

used Reservoir sampling alogrithmn to sample my dataset
successfully deployed the Random Forest Model

week 5-6  04/08/21 - 16/08/21 
I spent most of this time on hyperparamter tuning as result I didnt not have much change in code to commit
and also work load from my full time job and other repeat modules & has dwindle the time capital I could use to commit to the project.
So I have reduced the plan work for my project I will not be going with all 3 ML models. in order to wrap up then project in time. 

for the Skorch Nueral network although the training and testing accuracy is 70%. The human readable result (interpretation) does not make sense. If I cant make sense of it in the coming days I will be dropping the model


week 6-7  16/08/21 - 27/08/21
I spent most of this time simply integrating the machine learning with my Flask back end Deploying the  full project to heroku 
and integrating the full funtionalities of both front and back end. Things I managed acomplished inlcudes
1) deploying the Binary Neural network along with random forest and multi-class Nueral Network.
2) Write a program to calulate the number of correct & incorrect predictions/ classification 
3) fixed skorch neural nework result interpretation problem 
4) Wrote a program to graph the result 
5) Came up with  a simpler solution to graphing the result data by storing Data to Json this finxed issues that comes with higher order component  but also came with its own issues. 

Due to limited time I had for this project I will conclude the project done and spend the rest of my time on report and presenstation
